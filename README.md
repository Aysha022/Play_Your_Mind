### Project Description
Our Project "Play Your Mind" can read your emotions from your face and pour the music that your heart earns for!
It is a project to detect and recognize human emotions based on facial expressions. It aims to analyze emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more using facial data.


### The Problem Statement
Ever struggled to figure out if someone‚Äôs mad at you or just hungry? Decoding emotions can feel like cracking a secret code!

### The Solution
'Play_Your_Mind' takes the guesswork out of it by using facial expressions to detect emotions like happiness, sadness, or "I-need-coffee." Perfect for making life (and interactions) a little easier!
